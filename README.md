## Overview

**_Fruit Punch_** is an interactive web app game that tracks a user's motions through their built-in webcam. Punch the fruit that spawn randomly on screen! Clicking START will bring you to the Game Selection page:

1.  **Normal Mode**
    * Familarize yourself with the game! See how fast it takes you to squish 50 fruits!
2.  **Beat The Clock**
    * Now you're on the clock! See how many fruits you can destroy in just a minute!
3.  **Sudden Death**
    * Squish as many fruit as you can _without hitting a bomb!_ But be careful, after every round a new bomb is added to your game play!
